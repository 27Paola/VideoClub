# Project VideoClub 🎬

The organization of the video store has requested an interface where you can read, generate, modify and delete the data they have in their database. To do this, it creates a table that represents each record with its respective data, based on the existing downloaded Movie DB. The table can create new records and there is one in each the alternative to edit and delete.
